# README: Cloud Fundamentals and Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines cloud concepts, the shared responsibility model, and essential best practices for securely working with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

---

## What is the Cloud?

- **Definition**: The cloud is a set of remote servers accessible via the internet, offering computing resources like virtual machines, storage, and databases.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Managed remotely through central interfaces (e.g., Azure Portal, AWS Console).
  - Offers compute, storage, networking, and specialized services (e.g., IoT, AI/ML, DevOps tools).
  - Enables flexible scaling, cost optimization, and global accessibility.

## Key Cloud Service Models

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**:
   - Provides virtual machines, storage, and networking.
   - Example: AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines.
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**:
   - Delivers a platform for building, testing, and deploying applications.
   - Example: Azure App Service.
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**:
   - Fully managed software applications.
   - Example: Microsoft 365, Salesforce.

## Shared Responsibility Model

- Security and management responsibilities vary based on the service model:
  - **On-Premises**: Full control and full responsibility.
  - **IaaS**: Cloud provider manages hardware; users manage OS and applications.
  - **PaaS**: Cloud provider manages the OS and runtime; users focus on application code.
  - **SaaS**: Cloud provider manages everything except user data and configurations.
- Key takeaway: Security depends on proper configuration and user diligence.

## Cloud Security Best Practices

1. **Protect Credentials**:
   - Never expose SSH keys, passwords, or private keys in repositories or screen shares.
   - Store keys securely in an **SSH folder** or use password managers (e.g., KeePass).
2. **Use Tags**: Tag all resources with identifiers (e.g., owner’s name) for better management.
3. **Limit Permissions**: Grant minimal access required for each user/resource.
4. **Monitor Costs**: Always use pricing calculators before provisioning resources.
5. **Clean Up**: Delete unused resources to avoid unnecessary charges.
6. **Enable Region Restrictions**: Use authorized regions (e.g., UK South for Azure).

## Key Terms

- **Virtual Machines**: Compute instances running OS and applications.
- **Storage**: Example: AWS S3 (buckets), Azure Blob Storage.
- **Networking**: Virtual networks (AWS VPC, Azure Virtual Network).
- **Shared Responsibility**: Balance of control and responsibility based on service type.

---

## Cloud Provider Comparison

- **AWS**: Largest market share, diverse service offerings, great for flexibility.
- **Azure**: Ideal for organizations in the Microsoft ecosystem (e.g., Teams, Active Directory).
- **GCP**: Niche expertise, strong in AI/ML, offers premium opportunities due to lower market saturation.

## Reminders for Cloud Lab Usage

- Use only authorized resources; verify pricing beforehand.
- Shut down resources by 5:00 PM unless extra time is approved.
- Always adhere to guidelines for managing credentials and data securely.
