## Core Responsibilities

### 1. **Monitoring and Incident Response**

- Monitor existing applications and systems to ensure uptime and reliability.
- Handle alerts, identify issues, and resolve bugs to maintain system stability.
- Analyze logs and metrics to proactively detect and address potential problems.

### 2. **Continuous Improvement**

- Understand and contribute to the enhancement of software delivery processes.
- Collaborate across teams to identify inefficiencies and propose improvements.
- Foster a culture of continuous learning and development.

### 3. **Deployment Support**

- Assist with deploying new features or components of applications.
- Support the configuration and maintenance of CI/CD pipelines.
- Gradually take on more responsibilities in deploying full-scale applications.

### 4. **Agile Collaboration**

- Participate in daily stand-ups to discuss progress, plans, and blockers.
- Engage in sprint planning, review, and retrospective meetings.
- Collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver tasks efficiently.

### 5. **Security and DevOps Culture**

- Promote a security-first mindset by integrating security into all DevOps practices.
- Understand the concept of **DevSecOps** as a natural extension of DevOps.
- Ensure security, monitoring, and logging are built into systems from the ground up.
